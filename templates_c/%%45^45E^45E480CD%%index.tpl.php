<h3>Recent Changes (Lite Edition)</h3>
<p>
	This is the new lite version of the "Music Web". It has been drastically simplified. The problem with the old version was it didn't work
	half the time and when broke on someone I never got straight answers as to what went wrong. So I ripped out the user administration stuff
	which included user stats, user history, user styles, and the cart. The other version remains on-line at 
	<a href="../music_web">The Music Web</a>. This is now the lite edition branch or Music Web LE.  
</p>
<p>
	The has also been changes to the database model. This change should be mostly transparent but the original and the lite versions
	are using separate databases for now anyway. So there may be slight variances between the two. Eventually these 
	database improvements will be migrated to the original version.
</p>
<h3>Album Art Missing Bug.</h3>
<p>
	I noticed there is some album art not showing where I am sure it exists in the database. I will figure this out soon and remove this message.
</p>
<h3>A couple of steps backwards.</h3>
<p>
	If you happen to notice there are a few things not working that were before. Yes, I broke them. Fortunately I leaned some new things
	in the midst of experimenting so things will better than ever after I get them to work again.
</p>
<h3>The music / database / sql / search / browser / whatever?</h3>
<p>
    I finally databased most but not all of my music files. For now I have imported
    just .mp3 files. I plan on doing .wma then .ogg &amp; .flac more on this later.
    It is running at over <strong>23,356</strong> songs listings at the point I wrote
    this <a href="music_stats.php">(see stats)</a>. Maybe I should create a dynamic
    counter here, hum, maybe. Anybody who has been around me for over 10 minutes has
    probably heard me mention I was planning on doing this and I finally did (By heard
    I don't mean say you were actually listening. So, don't bother wondering what hell
    I am talking about just know I told you, believe me I did). It didn't take so long
    because it was so hard, I am just that lazy.
</p>
<p>
    I have been told that my web site was plain &amp; needed to be prettied up. I agree
    so I have been playing with the style. I can handle most of the technological aspects
    of this but the artistic side is beyond me. So it may take awhile and some experimenting
    to get right. I plan on getting a few friends that are good in this area and give
    them access to site. If your one of them let me know 
	(<a href="mailto:<?php echo $this->_config[0]['vars']['admin_email']; ?>
subject=I%20can%20do%20it,%20give%20me%20access!"><?php echo $this->_config[0]['vars']['admin_email']; ?>
</a>).

<h3>
    The Rules</h3>
<hr />
<p>
    Since this is running on a box in my bedroom there are some bandwidth limitations/issues.
    So here a few things that would help with that in mind.
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong><em>No music downloads from 6pm to 11pm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Daylight_Time_%28North_America%29">
        CDT</a>!</em></strong> This has became a problem so I am stressing this point. </li>
    <li>Do not screw with the database. This assumes you are technically capable of doing
        so; you know who you are. I believe everything is locked down but I learn something
        new everyday. For instance today I have just learned I am almost out of beer. </li>
    <li>Please do not try to stream music. If you want a song please download it explicitly.
        If you just click on the link to play it, the file is downloaded every time you
        click it. Well it is if it is not cached which you have little control over. <strong>
            Besides wouldn't you rather have your own copy</strong>.
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>For those who this did not mean anything I will explain in laymen (aka Moron) terms.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Right-Click</strong> on the link then <strong>Save [Link|Target] As</strong>...
            </li>
            <li><strong>Notice:</strong> I said <strong>Right</strong> meaning not <strong>Left</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>And yes, I know if you <strong>Left-Click</strong> on the link, "It just starts
                playing (sometimes) and that it's like so cool" cool maybe but <strong>wrong</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>Once again, <strong>Right-Click</strong> on the link then <strong>Save [Link|Target]
                As</strong>... </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>Don't try to download the whole catalog. Be reasonable get a couple albums at a
        time &amp; I am sure the bandwidth usage will never even be noticed. Like I said
        earlier daytime and very late night are best. <b>You know if your filling the pipe for
            2 hours straight and I will too.</b> </li>
    <li>Anything else I am thinking should also be considered a rule. <strong>I need not
        inform you</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
    The search features are still being worked on I think it may fun to temporarily
    suspend Rule 2. since if someone manages to destroy the database I can simply run
    the importer again. I just ask to you remember how you screwed it so I can fix it.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
    If you think my web page sucks, well it is all about values. It's not that I do
    not value nice web pages, it's that I do not value your opinion. I have already
    heard it anyway. Oh sure it may have came from someone else but I didn't listen
    to them either so what the difference.

<strong>TagLib# Rocks</strong><br />
<p>
    I started using the open source TagLib# Library to to do the meta tagging reads
    on all my music importing. It looks great so so I think that it is going to make
    things much easier. It supports .mp3 .wma, .ogg, .flac, .ape &amp; more. So now
    I after I ramp up on the library I should be able to get close to 100% importing.
